This project demonstrates different types of inheritance in Python using animal and student examples:

- `single_inheritance.jv` – Dog inherits from Animal
- `multiple_inheritance.jv` – Duck inherits from Flyer and Swimmer
- `multilevel_inheritance.jv` – Cat inherits from Mammal > Animal
- `hierarchical_inheritance.jv` – Lion and Elephant inherit from Animal
- `hybrid_inheritance.jv` – Frog inherits from both Terrestrial and Aquatic
